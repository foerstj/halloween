A little mod for Dungeon Siege 1 / LoA.

## Installation & Compatibility
- This mod is made for LoA, and also alters LoA content. It should work with Vanilla, but wasn't tested thoroughly.
  - The pumpkin texture is misaligned in Vanilla. This can be remedied by using "Halloween - Pumpkin-vanilla-fix.dsres".
- This mod supports the original maps (KoE/UP/Yh/LoA/R2A) as well as some of my own (Ehland/EoS/UPZA). It affects other maps to a lesser extent.
- To install, simply put the .dsres files in the DSLOA folder.
- The "de" and "es" .dsres files are optional and contain translations into German and Spanish, which will be picked up if you have a German or Spanish installation.
- This mod adds the Pumpkin helmet to the pcontent pool, but it's low-level and not overpowered.
- To uninstall, simply remove the files again :)
- Not compatible with Wintermod.
  - Overrides original template files like natural_nonblocking.gas
  - Overrides original actor template files like of krug & spiders
  - Overrides original mood files
